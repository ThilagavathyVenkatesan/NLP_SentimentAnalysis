# NLP_SentimentAnalysis
This project analyzes user reviews and predicts sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative)using Machine Learning (XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) and Deep Learning (LSTM, GRU, BERT, DistilBERT) models..It also provides Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights like trends, word clouds, and sentiment comparisons.The goal is to gain insights into customer satisfaction, identify common concerns, and enhance the application's user experience.
Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è using Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Hugging Face Transformers, and Streamlit.
